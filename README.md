# MLEnd-London-Sounds-Project
Machine Learning Mini Project (ECS7020P)

The mini-project has two separate components:

Basic component: Using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an audio segment and predicts whether the audio segment has been recorded indoors or outdoors. (ECS7020P_miniproject_basic.ipynb)
Advanced component: Formulate your own machine-learning problem and build a machine-learning solution using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset. (ECS7020P_miniproject_advanced.ipynb)
